Pentops Contribution Guidelines
===============================

The Pentops project is in early development, contribution to date has been
limited to a small group of developers. If you have found the project and wish
to contribute, a very warm welcome to you! 

This document is a stub intended to be light, but future-proof enough that if
and when the project grows, and we forget to maintain this document, the
basics are still covered.

As with all github hosted open source projects, contributors are responsible for
ensuring that their contributions are able to be licensed under the project's
license - which in most/all cases will be the MIT license.

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct for all pentops projects is the [Contributor
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

## Reporting Issues

Please report issues on the project's github issues page.

## Contributing

Feel free to open pull requests with bug fixes or new features or support,
however please keep in mind we are not yet expecting a large number of
contributions, and haven't documented the overall project intent. Pentops is a
'very opinionated' framework, and we want all contributions to be in line with
that undocumented opinion... which is less than ideal.
